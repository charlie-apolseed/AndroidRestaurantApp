# ApolEats 🍽️

Welcome to **ApolEats**, an Android app designed for food lovers who want an ad-free, authentic way to discover and share restaurants with friends. ApolEats is a personal project created for fun, built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. It uses **Firebase** for authentication and networking, and it incorporates features that will leverage the **Google Maps API** to offer a seamless experience in finding great dining spots.

## Inspiration

> The only thing that makes me happier in this world than food is sharing food with friends. I created this app to make it easier to find and share restaurants among my friends. With services like Google Maps and TripAdvisor being riddled with advertisements and reviewers with objectively terrible tastes, a product like this felt invaluable.

In essence, ApolEats is all about fostering genuine connections over good food, providing a platform where friends can trust each other’s recommendations without sifting through paid reviews or dealing with questionable opinions.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Seamlessly log in and sign up through Firebase Authentication.
- **Restaurant Discovery**: View and explore restaurants shared within your friends’ network.
- **Google Maps Integration**: Coming soon! Utilize the Google Maps API to find restaurant locations and directions.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Enjoy recommendations from friends you trust, not strangers or paid advertisers.
- **Modern UI**: Built with Jetpack Compose, the app provides a smooth, intuitive user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
